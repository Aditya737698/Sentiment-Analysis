# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning

This project implements a sentiment analysis system using deep learning techniques to classify textual data (e.g., movie reviews or tweets) as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

It uses a trained neural network model built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, and includes steps for preprocessing, tokenization, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocesses raw text data using tokenization and padding
- Trains a neural network (e.g., LSTM or Dense layers) on labeled sentiment data
- Predicts sentiment from user input or batch text
- Visualizes model accuracy and loss during training
- Easily extendable to any custom dataset

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python 3
- 🧠 TensorFlow / Keras
- 📊 Matplotlib, Seaborn
- 🔠 NLTK / spaCy (optional for preprocessing)
- 📄 Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts

---

**📦 Example Output**
```bash
Input: "I really enjoyed this movie!"
Predicted Sentiment: Positive 😊

Input: "Terrible customer service."
Predicted Sentiment: Negative 😠
```

**🔄 Future Improvements**
```bash
Use pre-trained word embeddings like GloVe or BERT

Build a Flask/Streamlit web app interface

Extend to multi-language support

Add sentiment scoring (e.g., 1 to 5 scale)
